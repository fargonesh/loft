# Introduction

loft is a modern, interpreted programming language designed for clarity, expressiveness, and developer productivity. It combines functional programming concepts with practical imperative features, making it suitable for scripting, application development, and systems programming.

## Philosophy

loft is built on three core principles:

1. **Clarity over Cleverness**: Code should be easy to read and understand. Explicit is better than implicit.

2. **Practical Expressiveness**: Provide powerful abstractions without sacrificing simplicity. Features like closures, pattern matching, and error propagation make common tasks elegant.

3. **Developer Experience**: Great tooling matters. loft includes an LSP for editor integration, a package manager, code formatter, and documentation generator out of the box.

## Key Features

### Modern Type System
loft supports optional type annotations with runtime type checking. Write quick scripts without types, or add them for safety in larger projects.

### Functional Programming
First-class functions, closures with environment capture, and lambda expressions enable functional programming patterns while remaining approachable.

### Pattern Matching
Powerful pattern matching with destructuring makes working with complex data structures intuitive and safe.

### Error Handling
Explicit error handling with Result and Option types, plus the error propagation operator (?) for clean error flow.

### Module System
Simple and explicit imports with the `learn` keyword. Export symbols with `teach` to create reusable libraries.

### Async/Await
Native support for asynchronous programming with async functions and the await keyword.

### Great Tooling
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) for IDE integration
- Package manager for dependency management
- Code formatter for consistent style
- Documentation generator for API docs
- VSCode extension with syntax highlighting

## Use Cases

loft excels at:
- Command-line tools and utilities
- Scripting and automation
- Web services and APIs
- Data processing pipelines
- Configuration management
- Testing frameworks
- Educational projects
