# Introduction

Welcome! loft is a modern, interpreted language that's all about making your life easier as a developer. We've combined the power of functional programming with the straightforwardness of imperative coding, so you can build anything from quick scripts to full-scale apps without the headache.

## Why loft?

At the heart of loft, we believe in a few simple things:

1.  **Readability Above All Else**: Your code should be easy to understand. We prefer being clear over being "clever" — future you will thank us.
2.  **Power Without Complexity**: We want to give you powerful tools (like closures, pattern matching, and cleaner error handling) in a way that feels natural, not overwhelming.
3.  **Tooling Should Just Work**: A language is only as good as its tools. That's why loft comes with a built-in LSP, package manager, code formatter, and documentation generator right out of the box.

## The Good Stuff

### Modern (and Friendly) Types
loft lets you add type annotations when you want them, but checks them at runtime so you don't get bogged down in a complex compiler struggle. Fast scripts or rock-solid apps — the choice is yours.

### Functional, but Not Scary
First-class functions and closures let you write expressive, functional code that's actually approachable.

### Pattern Matching (the way it should be)
Destructuring and pattern matching let you handle complex data without breaking a sweat.

### Better Error Handling
Say goodbye to messy try-catches. Explicit `Result` and `Option` types, combined with the `?` operator, make error propagation a breeze.

### Clear Imports
Want to share your code? Use `teach` to export it and `learn` to bring it in. It's that simple.

### Async/Await
Native `async` and `await` handle concurrency without making you lose your mind.

### Everything in One Place
-   **LSP Support**: Get syntax highlighting and smart completions in your favorite editor.
-   **Package Manager**: Managing dependencies is simple and fast.
-   **Auto-formatter**: Keep your code looking clean without manual tweaks.
-   **Doc Generator**: Professional API docs generated from your comments.
-   **VS Code Support**: We have an extension that works right away.

## What can you build?

Anything! Well, mostly. loft is great for:
-   Quick CLI tools and helpers
-   Automation scripts that actually look good
-   Speedy APIs and web services
-   Transforming and processing data
-   Handling configurations
-   Writing test suites that don't suck
- Educational projects
